To this file I simply add a variable that stores the specific query. So for example, I would add the following variables:

$getAuthors = "SELECT * FROM authors";
$getBooks = "SELECT * FROM book";

and so on with your queries.

Turning to the page that displays the results — the one that actually uses the query — (lets call it authors.php), I have the include statement:

include "queries.php";

and of course the code to access my database:

link_id = db_connect();
[here you can use whatever particular code you personally use to connect to a mysql database]

Then I simply populate the $sql variable (where I previously would have stored the actual code of the query), with the following:

$sql = $getAuthors;
